# Stock_alerts
## Ingredients:
1. API
2. requests library
3. twilio (send messages)

I will be using a free API to check a certain stock's closing prices for 2 consecutive days to see whether
the stock gained or lost money. 
Once I get the info then I can decide whether I want to buy or sell the stock.
